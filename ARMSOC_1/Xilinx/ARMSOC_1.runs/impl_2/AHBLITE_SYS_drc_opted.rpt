REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 rf_reg[14][31]_i_14 has an input control pin rf_reg[14][31]_i_14/ADDRARDADDR[6] (net: DataAdr[4]) which is driven by a register (dut/arm/dp/pcreg/q_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
